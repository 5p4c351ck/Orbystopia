	The year is 2370, the solar system is fully populated and even though humans achieved a level of 
	  technological advancement that can keep them young and healthy indefinitely, this kind of luxury is only enjoyed by the rich.
	
	The moon has been terramorphed into a sanctuary where the rich enjoy their pseudo immortality, living hedonistic
	  lifes in their small paradise, oblivious to the reality that spans beyond the thick glass dome of their home.
	
	Around 80 billion people live on Earth, controlled by corporate entities, like private armies and security units.
	  Crime levels have reached their peak, and the only people living there by choice are either cops or scum, or both.

	Mars is home to 20 billion technofetishists, hackers, scientists and lucky people who just happen to be born there living in huge industrial
	 cities, mainly concerned with researching and inventing new technologies, their research is sponsored by rich folk on the moon who
	  drool over any new kind of tech or drug that can make their lives even more interesting.

	Several other people live in their spaceships wandering the void looking for scrap, unluckily for you, you are none of those people.
	 You are a netrunner that was born on earth and made a living by hacking corpos and selling their data to one another, until one day
	a private cybercrime unit kicked down your door and arrested you, they didn't care for a trial, they just put you in the next shuttle heading to   
	  your current home, Orbystopia, one of the many small abandonned space stations orbiting Earth. 
		
	To make matters even worse a bacterial infection has recently killed everyone in the station, out of the 62 people that inhabited the 
	  station you are the only one left, you had to push 61 floating bodies out of an airlock, at least being a netrunner means you 
	 can jack in to Cyberspace, which is your only way of communicating with other people and how you used to spend most of your time anyway.

                        You are in Cell-0, or what you called home for the last six months.

                        There is a Datastream terminal at the middle of the cell, fat wires
                    feed the terminal with data, like an umbilical cord nurturing a fetus.

                        There is a glass window on the side, giving you a good view of Earth,
                    the mother planet appears so close, yet completely out of reach.

                        There is a vending machine at the other side, filled with nutribars and
                    water bottles.

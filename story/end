Your heart races with anticipation, with trembling fingers, you connect the neural interface, feeling the cold flow of data penetrate your skull.
  Suddenly, the world around you dissolves into a torrent of code and cascading data streams.
 
You are no longer confined to the rusted corridors of Orbystopia, you are transcending spatiotemporal limitations,
  stepping into the ethereal realm of Martian cyberspace.

Towers of data soar high into the digital heavens, pulsating with electric symphonies of binary whispers.
 
The tranquil hum of the Martian cyberspace is abruptly shattered, you disconnect and violently return to your body,
  an explosive force propeled your body into a disorienting swirl, unplugging the neural link.

The whole station is turning around, the familiar sense of up and down becomes warped, distorted by the relentless rotation.

The alarms of the space station blare with an urgent, piercing intensity, cutting through the air like a knife.
  Earth probably found out about the data, this is them deleting the evidence of their atrocities.

A bittersweet sense of acceptance washes over your being, you take solace in the knowledge that, albeit briefly,
  you had the privilege of experiencing the ethereal realms of Martian cyberspace.

Another missile hits cutting the station in half hurling you in the dark cold void, you become part of the universal dance, 
your energy dispersing into the infinite expanse, forever intertwined with the fabric of the cosmos.

				This is the most stuffed cell in the whole station, there is a big terminal at the wall infront of you and 
			    an absolute shitload of electronis floating around, hundreds of wires are hanging from the ceiling like the tendrils of some industrial plant,
			the guy that used to live here was an enigmatic figure that never talked to anyone, he looked very paranoid and rarely left this cell, you should
				definitely investigate this place, especially his terminal.

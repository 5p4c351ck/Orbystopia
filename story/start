                        You feel a familiar electric sensation running up and down your spine,
                    as your perception violently disconnects from the datastream.

                        The somatosensory implants make chatroom kicks live up to the name.
                    Maybe you should keep your radical opinions to your self next time.

                        Your body feels sore, turns out that microgravity doesn't liberate you from bad posture,
                    you remember you haven't had anything to eat today, you should grab a snack.

                        You look around  but all that's floating around is hardware and food wrappers,
                    jacking in again appears appealing, but you are too dizzy and tired to do it.

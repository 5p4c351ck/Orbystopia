# Orbystopia

A text Based Space Adventure set in a dystopian cyberpunk future.



## Compile and run the program

Compile with make

```

$ make && make clean
```
 

Run

```

$ ./Orbystopia
```

**Note**: I wrote this back when I was learning C which was my first programming language, 
so dont use this as an example of how to write code.

**Note**: This program doesn't sanitize user input of check for buffer overflows,
so if you try to break it you will, you can still play it though.
